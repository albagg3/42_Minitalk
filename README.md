# Minitalk
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program
using UNIX signals. There are two programs, client and server.
*Bonus
The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the
client and supports unicode characters.


⬇ To pull files ⬇
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:albagg3/42_Minitalk.git
